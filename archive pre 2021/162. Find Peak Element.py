# A peak element is an element that is greater than its neighbors.

# Given an input array nums, where nums[i] â‰  nums[i+1], find a peak element and return its index.

# The array may contain multiple peaks, in that case return the index to any one of the peaks is fine.

# You may imagine that nums[-1] = nums[n] = -inf

# Input: nums = [1,2,3,1]
# Output: 2
# Explanation: 3 is a peak element and your function should return the index number 2.

# Input: nums = [1,2,1,3,5,6,4]
# Output: 1 or 5
# Explanation: Your function can return either index number 1 where the peak element is 2,
#              or index number 5 where the peak element is 6.

# Your solution should be in logarithmic complexity.
