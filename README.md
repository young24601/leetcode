# leetcode

Previous leetcode attempts have failed.  Now it is time to truly focus and work on myself for the betterment of my family.  Let's do it!

First I will work on "Top Interview Questions" of which there are 145.  45 Easy, 78 Medium, and 22 Hard.

The easy should be completed by May 27 (6.5 problems per day).  I will then estimate time to complete Medium.


Then I will work on "Top 100 Liked Questions" and then look at some of the company specific problems.
